# Improving-Clinical-Trust-in-Bayesian-Medical-Image-Segmentation
This project explores Bayesian U-Net architectures for lung segmentation in chest X-rays with an emphasis on uncertainty-aware learning. By aligning predictive uncertainty with segmentation errors, the model improves both accuracy and clinical trustworthiness.
